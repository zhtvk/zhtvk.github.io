Hi! My name is Viktor Slavkovikj. I am an engineer and a researcher in computer
science. I obtained a PhD in computer science from Multimedia Lab (currently <a
href="http://datasciencelab.ugent.be/about" target="_blank">Data Science
Lab</a>) of <a href="http://www.ugent.be/en" target="_blank">Ghent
University</a>, Belgium in June 2016. This blog will largely cover topics from
machine learning and computer vision, which are two principal areas of my
research interests.

During my PhD, I have mostly worked on improving the outcome of different
computer vision tasks, such as object classification and detection, by using
multimodal data. More details over my research can be found in my <a
