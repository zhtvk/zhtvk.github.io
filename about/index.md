Hi! My name is Viktor Slavkovikj. This is my web page where I hope to
occasionally blog about my work and topics spanning my research interests. These
include predominantly machine learning, computer vision, natural language
processing, and deep learning.

**Short Bio**: I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from <a
href="http://www.ugent.be/en" target="_blank">Ghent University</a>, Belgium,
where I have mostly worked on improving the outcome of different computer vision
tasks, such as object classification and detection, by using multimodal
data. More details over my research can be found in my <a

target="_blank">thesis</a>.
